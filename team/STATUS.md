## MVP Status

* Team is on track to complete all stories for MVP by noon a week from Thursday (05/07/2020)


What obstacles remain to completing MVP:
* Figuring out a good way to generate URLs

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP
* Generating a bad API key and testing with it
* Firebase vs Mongo


* Unresolved application design issues
  * Production does not currently have API key
