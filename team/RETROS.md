# Retro 4/20/20

* Led by: Ryan Simone
* Present: Brandon Nadell, Pranav Madapurmath, Yuval Steinhart, Zhiyu Ning
* Absent: Isaac Lam

## Action Item

* a goal: Continue working on our previously agreed upon learning goals for this week. Also set up a main-web page that we can pull from master onto our local branches and build off of. 
* a change: Since we are getting further along the process, we will make a greater effort to keep or teammates informed on the individual progresses and setbacks on our team slack channel. 
* a measurement: The amount of activity on the slack channel after this meeting. 

## Retro Assessment

* I used the Darby/Larsen 5-Step Retro because I thought this would be the most beneficial in starting to plan the approach working on the project.
* I would say it went well thanks to the involvment of my team in discussions based off of the questions I asked. This allowed our team to have an understanding as to what we thought should be or goal moving forward. Our collaboration allowed us to build off of each other's ideas to create one sound goal. 
* I would recommend being open to veering off of the retro outline you created due to the flow of discussion amongst the team.
